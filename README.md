# AI-Assisted Chat Evidence Triage for Cybercrime Investigations

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work for the master thesis project "AI-Assisted Chat Evidence Triage for Cybercrime Investigations for the Cybersecurity Management and Data Sovereignty Master Program (2025–2027).

The project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can assist law enforcement investigators during the initial triage of chat messages extracted through digital forensic processes.

The system is designed as a decision-support tool, not an automated decision-making system, and follows a strict human-in-the-loop approach.

## Scope and Limitations
✔ Focused exclusively on chat messages extracted via digital forensics  
✔ Intended for investigative triage and prioritization support  
✔ Uses only synthetic and simulated chat data  

✘ Does not perform automated investigative conclusions  
✘ Does not replace human investigators  
✘ Not a production forensic tool  

## First Semester Status
Completed during the first semester:
- Definition of problem scope limited to chat evidence
- Legal and ethical analysis (GDPR, proportionality, human oversight)
- Conceptual system architecture design
- Methodology and implementation planning

Planned for next semesters:
- proof-of-concept prototype (Python + NLP basics)
- Refinement of message classification logic
- Improved relevance scoring mechanisms
- Structured evaluation and validation
- Explainability and investigator trust analysis

## Legal and Ethical Notice
This repository does NOT contain real investigative data.
All datasets used here will be created solely for academic research purposes.
The project follows EU data protection principles and ethical AI guidelines.
