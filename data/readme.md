# Data Directory

This directory is reserved for synthetic chat datasets that will be created and used during the implementation and evaluation phases of the project.

No real investigative, personal, or operational data will be stored in this repository.

All datasets will be:
- Fully synthetic
- Created for academic research only
- Used exclusively for testing AI-assisted chat triage methods

This approach ensures compliance with legal, ethical, and data protection requirements.
