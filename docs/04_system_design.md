# Conceptual System Design

The proposed system operates on chat datasets obtained after forensic extraction.

The conceptual architecture includes:
- Chat data ingestion
- Text preprocessing and normalization
- Message classification by relevance
- Entity extraction (names, locations, financial indicators)
- Relevance scoring for prioritization
- Human-in-the-loop review

At this stage, the system design is conceptual and intended to guide future implementation and prototyping.
