# Methodology and Implementation Plan

The methodology combines literature review, legal analysis, and system design.

First semester activities focused on:
- Defining the project scope
- Reviewing relevant academic and professional literature
- Identifying legal and ethical constraints
- Designing a conceptual system architecture

Future phases will include a lightweight proof-of-concept prototype using Python and open-source NLP libraries, followed by structured evaluation.
