# Legal and Ethical Framework

The processing of chat messages involves personal and potentially sensitive data.
This project is designed in compliance with EU legal and ethical frameworks, including GDPR principles and law enforcement data protection requirements.

Key principles include:
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Proportionality
- Transparency and explainability
- Human oversight

The system avoids fully automated decision-making and does not produce legally binding conclusions. All outputs are advisory and subject to investigator review.
