# Investigative Context

Chat-based communication platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Discord are frequently used in cybercrime activities.

After digital forensic extraction, investigators often face large volumes of chat messages, most of which are irrelevant to the case under investigation.

Manual review of these datasets is time-consuming and contributes to investigative backlogs.

This project addresses the need for structured triage mechanisms that assist investigators in identifying potentially relevant chat content early in the investigative process.
