# Project Scope

This project focuses on the design of an AI-assisted digital evidence triage framework for chat messages encountered in cybercrime investigations.

The system is limited to chat data that has already been lawfully extracted through standard digital forensic procedures. Acquisition, preservation, and integrity 
verification are explicitly out of scope.

The objective is to support investigators during the initial review phase by organizing and prioritizing chat messages based on potential investigative relevance.

The system is designed as a decision-support tool and does not replace human judgment or investigative responsibility.
